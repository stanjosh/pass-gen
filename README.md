# Password Generator


## pass-gen

This is a JavaScript-based password generator. It allows you to select a password length of between 8 and 128 characters (in steps of 8). It allows the use of special characters, capital letters, and numbers at the user's discretion. There is a progress bare to show how secure the password is.

## how it works

based on the inputs in the form, the main function concatenates different arrays of characters. the character arrays are generated by another function that takes two characters in the utf-8 character set and iterates between them, collecting each character in an array. After the character sets are concatenated, the full array is sorted using Math.random, and then the first 8-128 characters of that jumble are sliced and returned.

i gameified it a bit with a progress bar, but that is a work in... *progress*
